## 2. Tech Stack
- **Backend Framework**: Laravel (PHP)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Queues**: Laravel Queues (Redis or Database-backed)
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS with a Load Balancer for high availability and scalability

## 3. Key Features
- User Authentication and Role Management
- Payment Processing (Card, UPI, Crypto, APM)
- Transaction History and Reporting
- Dynamic KYC Verification
- Multi-currency Support
- Real-time Notifications
- Admin Dashboard for Analytics and Management

## 4. High-Level Architecture
### 4.1. System Diagram
Below is the high-level architecture of the PayAgency system:

1. **Frontend (Presentation Layer)**
   - Built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
   - Implements a responsive design for mobile and desktop devices.

2. **Backend (Application Layer)**
   - **Laravel Framework**: Handles business logic, routing, and API layer.
   - **Queue Management**: Laravel Queues are used for asynchronous tasks like payment processing, sending notifications, and Bulk Data processing.
   - **Payment Processing**: Integrates with third-party APIs for card, UPI, and crypto payments.
   - **KYC Management**: Dynamically renders KYC forms based on user type and step.

3. **Database (Data Layer)**
   - **MySQL**: Stores user data, transactions, KYC data, and audit logs.
   - Optimized for high-volume transactional operations.

4. **Cloud Infrastructure**
   - **AWS EC2 Instances**: Hosts the Laravel application.
   - **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across multiple instances for high availability.
   - **S3**: Stores KYC documents and other static assets.
   - **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: Managed MySQL database instance for scalability and security.
   - **CloudWatch**: Monitors logs and system performance.

5. **Third-Party Integrations**
   - Payment Gateway APIs for processing payments.
   - Notification Services (e.g., AWS SES, Twilio) for email and SMS alerts.
   - Analytics tools for admin dashboards.

### 4.2. Security Considerations
- **Authentication**: Secure login with password hashing and optional 2FA.
- **Data Protection**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive data and secure APIs.
- **KYC Compliance**: Adheres to regulatory standards for handling personal data.
- **DDoS Protection**: Implemented via AWS Shield and CloudFront.

### 4.3. Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more EC2 instances behind the load balancer as traffic increases.
- **Database Scaling**: Use read replicas for MySQL to distribute read-heavy operations.
- **Queue Scaling**: Scale queue workers dynamically based on task volume.


## 5. Deployment Strategy

### 5.1. Staging Environment
- A pre-production environment on AWS with the same setup as production.

### 5.2. Production Environment
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across EC2 instances.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Automatically scales instances based on traffic.
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Minimizes downtime during updates.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automates deployment using tools like GitHub Actions.

## 6. Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Monitoring Tools**: AWS CloudWatch for logs, alarms, and performance metrics.
- **Error Tracking**: Integrated tools like Sentry for error reporting.
- **Routine Backups**: Automated database backups to S3 for disaster recovery.
